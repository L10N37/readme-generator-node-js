# Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

<br>
This is a README generator created for the Monash module 9 challenge! 
<br>
<br>
For the challenge we were provided the starter code here: <br>
https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma 
<br>
<br>
This application does not launch in a browser and instead uses a console line interface via Node.js <br>
<br>
Dependencies required: <br>
<br>
Node.js <br>
Enquirer <br>
<br>
The application can be invoked inside visual studio code with 'node index' or 'node index.js' inside it's integrated terminal, 
providing the dependencies are correctly installed and added to the system environment variables. Once these dependencies are installed
you will need to restart your PC if using windows. This same scenario has not being replicated in any other operating system at this stage.
You might be best off restarting your PC after installation on other operating systems like Ubuntu and other linux flavours as well.
