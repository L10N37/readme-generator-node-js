## Installation

There are a couple of dependencies required - Node.JS and Inquirer. An instructional video will be provided on the applications use.
<br>
<br>
      
## Usage
<br>
An instructional video is on the way but basically once this application is launched, you select a license from a list and follow the prompts with your input.
<br>
<br>

## License

## Tests
<br>
The application has being tested and it seems to be bug free. The base code was actually generated by chatGPT and heavily modified. The hardest aspect of the project was using the inquirers list function (to list the licenses) in conjunction with the node prompts. I wasn't able to figure out how to use the prompts first, then add a call to the inquirer function (with the license lists) and use it's 'return' as a part of the readme data. The application insisted on continuing without waiting for user input and bugging out. A refactor that placed the node prompts section in the '.then' section of the inquirer function did the trick, hence you select the desired license first and then you are prompted with other questions in regards to the rest of the readme sections.
